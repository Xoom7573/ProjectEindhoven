      "As part of an exciting international project for school, we arrived on Sunday evening at around 8 pm, filled with anticipation for the adventure ahead. After checking into our accommodation and unpacking our bags, we had the pleasure of meeting our fellow project members. It was fascinating to learn about their backgrounds and cultures, and we exchanged stories and ideas that helped us get to know each other better.",
      "To get a feel for the local scene, we decided to take a walk to the city center. It was a 30-minute walk, but it was worth it for the beautiful sights along the way. As we reached the city, we decided to visit a local bar and grab some drinks. The atmosphere was vibrant, and we soaked up the energy and excitement of the city.      ",
      "Over our drinks, we discussed our project goals and plans for the coming days. It was inspiring to hear everyone's ideas and to see how we could work together to achieve our objectives.",
      "All in all, it was an incredible start to our international project, and we're looking forward to what the rest of our time here will bring. Keep following our journey for more updates!"

      `Today was the official start of our international project, and we were excited to meet our teacher who would lead us on this adventure. After a brief introduction, we dove right into a lecture challenge called the "Smombie Run Challenge." It was a fun way to kick off the day, and it got us moving and energized.`,
      "Next, we received an introduction to the project and met our team members. We spent some time brainstorming ideas and getting to know each other's strengths and interests. It was fascinating to see the different perspectives and ideas that emerged from our discussions.",
      "During lunch, we enjoyed a variety of delicious sandwiches, fueling us up for the next part of the day. We had a guest lecture on future technologies, including the exponential growth of computing power and the potential impact on employment. It was eye-opening to think about how technology will shape our future.",
      "After the lecture, we had the opportunity to talk about our ideas for the Smombie Run Challenge. We shared our unique perspectives and ideas on how to approach the challenge, and it was inspiring to see the different approaches and creativity from everyone.",
      "Later in the day, we had the chance to present and pitch our ideas to the group. It was nerve-wracking, but also a great learning experience. After that, we had a cultural tasting, which allowed us to sample some of the local cuisine and learn more about the culture.",
      "In the evening, we decided to eat in the hotel and relax after a busy day. Some of us ventured out to explore the city, while others opted for a more leisurely evening in. It was a great way to end the day, and we're excited to see what the rest of the trip has in store for us."

      "Our first lecture and workshop was about concepting, and it was fascinating to learn about the most important aspects of developing a unique concept. We learned about the importance of having a unique selling point and finding ways to satisfy our users. We also learned about the value of user testing to validate our ideas, as well as the role of role-playing in presenting concepts to stakeholders.",
      "After the lecture, we worked on our concept ideas, building on what we had learned and discussed earlier. Later in the day, we had a lecture on game design and game mechanics. It was interesting to see how game design principles could apply to other areas of life and business.",
      "We then had the opportunity to work on a game design document with our teams, and continued working on developing our concepts further. We had pre-prepared sandwiches for lunch and continued working throughout the afternoon.",
      "Towards the end of the day, we had a wrap-up presentation to share our progress and get feedback from our teacher and fellow students. It was exciting to see how much progress we had made in just two days!",
      "To end the day on a high note, we were treated to delicious street food in the form of Mexican street rolls. It was the perfect way to relax and unwind after a busy day. We can't wait to see what tomorrow brings!"
